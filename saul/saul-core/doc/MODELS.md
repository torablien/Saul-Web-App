* Designing flexible learning models including various configurations such as:

   * Local models i.e. single classifiers. (Learning only models (LO)).
   * Constrained conditional models (CCM)[1] for training independent classifiers and using them jointly for global decision making in prediction time. (Learning+Inference (L+I)).
   * Global models for joint training and joint inference (Inference-Based-Training (IBT)).
   * Pipeline models for complex problems where the output of each layer is used as the input of the next layer.
